Facebook is full of shit. Those 300 people that have been 
invited to your party will more realistically turn out to be just 50\. 
And the 600 that said they were 'going' to your next show certainly 
haven't bought their tickets.

For as long as I've held events, I find myself getting annoyed at a shallow turnout, even though turnout projections have been taken into account. Especially frustrating is the friends who personally agreed to attend, only to find that they never came. It only takes a moment of emotional detachment to realise what's really going on.

People don't turn up to events for a multitude of reasons. And, as a person, you also know these reasons, because unless you're an absolute machine, with infinite funds, absolute confidence, and a total disregard for social pressure, you have skipped out on an event you've been invited to. In fact, you've probably skipped out on hundreds of events in your lifetime.

We don't show up to events because we don't have time, because they conflict with other events, because we can't afford to, because we're working, because we're too tired, and because we don't think it will be worth the effort. We feel awkward turning up to an event by ourselves if we don't know anyone else there, so often if a friend bails, most of the time, we also bail. We can sometimes feel intimidated by events too, and aggravated by bombardments of event invitations and updates on social media. You know all this, because you have expereinced this.

There will always be no-shows. Life gets in the way of fun, and that's just how it is. But as musicians, event organisers, and party makers, we need to understand our audience and mitigate as much of these issues as possible, and all it takes is a little bit of empathy. We need to show people, without hammering them with notifications and personal messages, that this event is worth the effort. We need to try and plan ahead to avoid conflicting with other events that our specific audience might attend.

However, there are two factors that will encourage attendance more than any other factor: excitement, and social pressure. Both are inherently emotional factors, and as such are difficult to understand and generate.

I'm sure you've also felt excited by an event. The second you see the poster, the picture, the post, or hear about it from a friend, something just clicks in your head, and that's it. You're super keen. You're going to that event, no matter what. But, realise that this emotion will be driven by different reasons for different people, for instance, I'm sure that not everyone in Melbourne had a moment when they heard about Parkway Drive's recent IRE tour. The second I heard about it, my mind was focused on getting a ticket immediately -- but that's because I f\*cking love Parkway Drive. What will it take to get your audience excited like that?

It's super hard to ahceive that with smaller events though, so the other most important factor is social pressure. Nothing makes me want to go to an event more, even if I was skeptical at first, than a couple of my mates asking me "Hey man, you going to x on Friday?" It's this social buzz in friendship circles that gets people going to events -- particularly smaller ones. Because we don't like going alone, if you can convince one person to be dead set on going, chances are you've sold 2 -- 5 tickets though just one individual.

Why don't people turn up to events? Take a second to step into your audience's shoes, and you might just find out.
